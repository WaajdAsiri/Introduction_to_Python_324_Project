This program has 5 functions, and the main while loop

input_weather_data() function:
•	Takes the date, temperature, humidity, and rain from the user
•	Store the input in the weather_data.txt file to use it in different functions later
•	Print a message to tell the user that the data has been saved

The user can use this function when they press 1 in the main loop 

load_weather_data() function:
•	Open the file weather_data.txt
•	Save the file data in the lists: dates, temps, humidities, and rains
•	Return the lists

The user can’t use this function directly, but it will be called 3 times in the functions: calculate_statistics(),  visualize_weather_data(), and display_summary() to get the grades

Calculate_statistics() function:
•	Load the data by calling the function load_weather_data()
•	Calculate the average temperature and humidity, the highest and lowest temperatures, and how many rainy days
•	Print the calculations

The user can directly use this function when they press 2 in the main loop

Visualize_grades() function:
•	Load the data by calling the function load_weather_data()
•	Use matplotlib to create a line chart
•	Show the line chart
•	Use matplotlib to create a scatter plot
•	Show the scatter plot

The user can directly use this function when they press 3 in the main loop

Display_summary() function:
•	Load the data by calling the function load_weather_data()
•	Calculate the total number of days, average temperature, and humidity, and the hottest and coldest days
•	Print the calculations

The user can directly use this function when they press 4 in the main loop

The main while loop:
•	Set the condition as True 
•	Get input from the user and save it in a choice variable, print to the user the instructions of which number he should press for each task
•	Check for the user's choice and call the wanted function 
•	If the choice is 5, print a goodbye message and break the loop to exit the program
•	If the choice is not a valid input, the user gets a message to declare it and continue the loop


Why do we use a file to save the weather data instead of saving it in a list or dictionary in the program?
	To save the data for later use, because as soon as the program is closed, the data will disappear.
And we need to save it for later use or go back to it for references. And to make the program usable for different files.

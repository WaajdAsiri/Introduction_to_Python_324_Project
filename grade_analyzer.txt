This program has 5 functions, and the main while loop

Imput_grades() function:
•	Takes the  student name and the student grade from the user
•	Store the input in the grades.txt file to use it in different functions later
•	Print a message to tell the user that the student's name and grade have been saved

The user can use this function when they press 1 in the main loop 

Load_grades() function:
•	Open the file grades.txt
•	Save the file data in the variable value
•	Check for the numbers pattern to extract numbers only from the data
•	Save it in the list of grades
•	Return the list of grades

The user can’t use this function directly, but it will be called 3 times in the functions: calculate_statistics(),  visualize_grades(), and display_summary() to get the grades

Calculate_statistics() function:
•	Load the grades by calling the function load_grades()
•	Calculate the sum, highest, and lowest grade with a for loop to check each element in the list
•	Calculate the average
•	Print the average, highest, and lowest grade

The user can directly use this function when they press 2 in the main loop

Visualize_grades() function:
•	Load the grades by calling the function load_grades()
•	Print the grades
•	Open grades.txt file to read the students' names
•	Check for the string pattern and save the names in the list names
•	Print the names
•	Create a histogram plot for the grades, give it a title, and labels for the x and y axes 
•	Show the histogram
•	Create a bar chart plot for the names and grades, give it a title and labels for the x and y axes, and a limit for the y axis
•	Show the bar chart

The user can directly use this function when they press 3 in the main loop

Display_summary() function:
•	Load the grades by calling the function load_grades()
•	Print the number of students using the grades list
•	Calculate the sum, pass students, and fail students using a for loop to check each element in the list
•	Print the average, passed, and failed students

The user can directly use this function when they press 4 in the main loop

The main while loop:
•	Set the condition as True 
•	Get input from the user and save it in a choice variable, print to the user the instructions of which number he should press for each task
•	Check for the user's choice and call the wanted function 
•	If the choice is 5, print a goodbye message and break the loop to exit the program
•	If the choice is not a valid input, the user gets a message to declare it and continue the loop


Why do we use a file to save the students' names and grades instead of keeping them in a list or dictionary in the program?
	To save the data for later use, because as soon as the program is closed the data will disappear,
And we need to save it for later use or go back to it for references. And to make the program usable for different files.
